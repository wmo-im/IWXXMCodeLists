# Code lists used within the IWXXM XML standard

The IWXXM Code Tables and Concepts are represented here as individual files in CSV format.

These code lists are also published in the [WMO Manual on Codes](https://community.wmo.int/activity-areas/wis/wis-manuals).

The CSV files are converted to TTL format and incorporated into the [WMO Code Registry](https://codes.wmo.int/).

If there is any discrepancy, the WMO Manual on Codes is the authoritative source.
