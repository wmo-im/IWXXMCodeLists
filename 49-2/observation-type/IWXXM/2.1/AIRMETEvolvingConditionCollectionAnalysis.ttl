        dct:description  "AIRMETEvolvingConditionAnalysis (a subclass of SamplingObservation from METCE) is intended for use when reporting an observed aggregate set of meteorological conditionsconcerning the occurrence or expected occurrence of specified en-route weather phenomena which may affect the safety of low-level aircraft operations and which was not already included in the forecast issued for low-level flights in the flight information region concerned or sub-area thereof. The result of this observation type shall refer to a single EvolvingMeteorologicalCondition which represents an AIRMET observation of meteorological conditions. AIRMETEvolvingConditionAnalysis enforces the following additional constraints: “featureOfInterest” shall refer to an entity of type SF_SamplingSurface and the associated “sampledFeature” must be an airspace."@en ;
