        dct:description  "SIGMETEvolvingConditionCollectionAnalysis (a subclass of SamplingObservation from METCE) is intended for use when reporting an observed or forecast aggregate set of meteorological conditions hazardous to flight  over a large airspace, including anticipated intensity change plus speed and direction of motion. The result of this observation type shall refer to a single SIGMETEvolvingConditionCollection which represents a SIGMET observation or forecast of meteorological conditions. SIGMETEvolvingConditionCollectionAnalysis enforces the following additional constraints: “featureOfInterest” shall refer to an entity of type SF_SamplingSurface and the associated “sampledFeature” must be an airspace."@en ;
