        dct:description  "MeteorologicalAerodromeForecast (a subclass of ComplexSamplingMeasurement from METCE) is intended for use when reporting an aggregate set of forecast meteorological conditions at an aerodrome. The result of this observation type shall refer to an entity of type MeteorologicalAerodromeForecastRecord. MeteorologicalAerodromeForecast enforces the following additional constraints: ‘featureOfInterest’ shall refer to an entity of type SF_SamplingPoint and the associated ‘sampledFeature’ must be an Aerodrome. This class is also related but not identical to MeteorologicalAerodromeTrendForecast which is reported on a METAR/SPECI - conditions reported in trend forecasts in METAR/SPECI differ from forecast groups in a TAF. The TAF forecast group from/to variants (FM, TL, AT, etc.) are represented on the OM_Observation validTime, which is always an instance of TM_Period. When there is only an instant at which a condition occurs, the start and end time are the same."@en .
