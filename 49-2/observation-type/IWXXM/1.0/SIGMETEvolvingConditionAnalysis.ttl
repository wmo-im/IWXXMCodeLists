        dct:description  "SIGMETEvolvingConditionAnalysis (a subclass of SamplingObservation from METCE) is intended for use when reporting an observed or forecast aggregate set of meteorological conditions hazardous to flight over a large airspace, including anticipated intensity change plus speed and direction of motion. The result of this observation type shall refer to a single EvolvingMeteorologicalCondition which represents a SIGMET observation or forecast of meteorological conditions. SIGMETEvolvingConditionAnalysis enforces the following additional constraints: ‘featureOfInterest’ shall refer to an entity of type SF_SamplingSurface and the associated ‘sampledFeature’ must be an airspace."@en .
